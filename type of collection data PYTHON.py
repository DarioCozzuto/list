#List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
#Dictionary is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.
